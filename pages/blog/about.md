## Just a Tish About Us

We are a mid-30s couple with two kids.  My husband, son, and daughter are all neurodivergent which gives them superpowers.  I on the other hand try to navigate surviving Complex Trauma from all forms along with living through new traumas as they arrive.  I am undergoing a never-ending fight against Neuroendocrine Cancer (NET Cancer) and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.  I am missing part of my lung, thanks to the wonderful Cancer, but refuse to let it slow me down. Anxiety is always at my side like a third saggy boob along with current undiagnosed medical issues.

> If this all seems chaotic it's because it is.  My coping mechanisims are signing myself up for more than I can handle and proving myself wrong.

Just when you thought that was enough for anyone to tackle, well, we purchased our first home on 2/22/22.  We were previously renting and had to rush to buy.  Our home wasn't perfect, but I have a vision in my mind, and plenty of Pinterest boards to back me up of the beautiful home it will turn into.

>If you lost track that is Cancer, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Trauma, Anxiety, New Homeowners, Neurodivergent Family Members, and undiagnosed medical problems.

If this sounds at all interesting to you or even a hot mess express that you can't look away from, well follow along!
