## On The Streets

The first words spoken to me when meeting a new person are usually, "Rhiannon? The Fleetwood Mac Song?"  In the Song Rhiannon is refereed to as a goddess, and as much as I would like to admit that I am indeed a goddess over the course of my 28 years I have developed my own definition of my name.  Rhiannon means to be unique and always against all odds. Rhiannon is an emotional warrior.  Rhiannon is Brave.  Rhiannon takes each day as it approaches and hops aboard each rocket as it rides the roller coaster that is her life.  Do you want to name your unborn child after me? Or do you want to name them after the Fleetwood Mac song?  I think the choice is pretty simple.

## Coming to Terms

During the month of August, I hit rock bottom.  I was having some of the worst Anxiety Attacks, to the point I was vomiting which means I couldn't keep my anxiety medication down.  I was shaking in my skin, literally.  It was the worst. I didn't sleep.  I was vomiting 15-20 times a day, and not coping well.  I was desperate to do anything to get past this anxiety, but felt like it was never ending.  I tried essential oils, meditation, exercise, watching videos, and reading (which was horrible).  I was willing to try ANYTHING!  I don't know what essentially stopped this horrible rampage, but I came up with a motto.  During my rough times where I am in a ton of pain, I have a bad habit of staying in bed, in my pjs.  I would lay in bed all day watching random videos. After this week called, HELL!  I discovered some things that help with coping and living with anxiety.
