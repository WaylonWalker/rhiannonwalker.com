## Always Learning New Techniques

When news comes in that your Best Friend is having a baby, I knew right away that a quilt was the way to go.  I was so excited to take on this task, but at the same time I was worried it would not be done in time. My previous project took me 3 years…seriously!!! That’s why I went on a search for an easy method to making a cute project. I came across this Craftsy class.  This is not sponsored by the way, just what I used.  The official title was "Fusible Applique Made Easy" by Wendi Gratz_

## About the Class

This class was really quite easy.  The videos did a great job at breaking things down into steps.  This was my very first time doing anything with applique or even quilting as I went.  These will be steps that I hope to use in future quilts.  Some of the things that challenged me quite a bit with this project were all the different curves of the animals.  I finally figured out that if you used the hand turn on the machine you could achieve the right curves.  That was surprisingly difficult for me to do.  I don’t know what it is, but usually when I am sewing I want to go fast.  Fast is not always the answer.  I am working at this, and learning that I can’t sew when I have a million different things on my list.

## Making It Mine

Other fun qualities of this quilt was that I was able to personalize the pattern.  I added arrow blocks, a skunk, and a hedgehog.  To make the arrows I simply just drew what I was looking for on the fusible interfacing and ironed it on.  One tip to make sure you pay attention to is the image on the interfacing needs to be mirrored.  The skunk was made using the squirrel pattern and just adding a white stripe, and the hedgehog was a free coloring page I came across that I traced onto the fusible interfacing.

## Finishing Touches

I finished this quilt up by adding cuddle fleece to the back, and just stitched in the ditch to attach it.  Next time I would probably use fleece on the back side, as I don’t care to work with cuddle fleece.  I purchased biased tape to go around the border with.  Everything I got to make was purchased from my local big box fabric store.  I only have one quilt shop close by, 35 minutes away, so I don’t always get over there.  

## The Big Reveal

My friend loves it.  It turned out so cute, and really turned me onto wanting to do some more applique in the future.  I got to go visit her after she had her baby and her little man looks adorable on all of those animal faces.  

Sorry there isn’t a ton of pictures of the construction.  This project was made over a year ago, before Cuttin Scrap was in my mind.  I can’t wait to bring you all on the journey of crafting with me.  Where the road is never straight.  It’s time to clean up the scrap, and make way for the next project.  Until Next Time!
